# Reviews

A **Review** is one plan version sent to the committee: the newest version of
an institutional plan, with who wrote it, where it belongs, and where its
decision stands. The Review queue, the dashboard and the
"Recently decided by you" list all read reviews.

### List reviews

`GET /v1/reviews`

Lists reviews, oldest submission first by default, so the head of the pending
list is always the plan that has waited longest.

**Who can call:** `committee`, `chief`

**Frontend today:** `reviewQueue(useDmpLibrary())` for pending reviews; the
decided list and the dashboard numbers are computed in `ReviewQueue.tsx` and
`useCommitteeDashboard`.

**Request** what each committee screen asks for:

```bash
# Dashboard and Review queue: everything waiting, longest-waiting first
curl "https://api.example.ac.th/v1/reviews?status=pending" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <session_token>"

# Review queue: the 8 most recent decisions
curl "https://api.example.ac.th/v1/reviews?status=approved,rejected&sort=-decided_at&limit=8" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <session_token>"

# Dashboard: decisions I made
curl "https://api.example.ac.th/v1/reviews?decided_by=me&sort=-decided_at&limit=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <session_token>"
```

**Response**

    {
      "object": "review",

}
```

**Parameters**

- `status` (array of enums, optional)
  Only reviews whose version has this status. Send one value or several,
  comma-separated. Defaults to all three.
  Possible enum values:
  - `pending`: waiting on a decision.
  - `approved`: approved by the committee.
  - `rejected`: sent back to the researcher.
- `decided_by` (string, optional)
  Only versions decided by this `user_id`, or `me` for the signed-in reviewer.
  Matches the version's `decided_by` or its `approver.user_id`.- `project_id` (string, optional)
  Only reviews of plans in this project.
- `submitted_after` (date-time, optional)
  Only versions submitted after this moment. The dashboard's
  "N submitted this week" card counts today and the six days before it, so it
  sends the start of the day six days ago.
- `sort` (enum, optional)
  Defaults to `submitted_at`. Possible enum values:
  - `submitted_at`: oldest submission first.
  - `-submitted_at`: newest submission first.
  - `-decided_at`: most recent decision first.
- `limit` (integer, optional)
  1–100. Defaults to 20.
- `starting_after` (string, optional)
  A review `id` to page after.

**Returns** a list of [Review](#the-review-object) objects, with
`total_count`. The dashboard's stat cards come from these counts:

| Card | Request | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Waiting my review | `status=pending` | `total_count` |
| Submitted this week | `status=pending&submitted_after=…` | `total_count` |
| Longest waiting | `status=pending&limit=1` | `data[0].days_waiting` |
| Approved by you | `decided_by=me&status=approved` | `total_count` |
| Decisions / sent back | `decided_by=me`, `decided_by=me&status=rejected` | `total_count` |
| Review queue badge (sidebar, every page) | `status=pending` | `total_count` |

The Review queue's "Recently decided" list shows committee decisions only;
plans a researcher finalized themselves are independent, so never reviews.

**Error codes**

| HTTP status code | Code | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `invalid_status` | `status` holds a value other than the three above. |
