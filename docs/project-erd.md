# Frontend data model ERD

This diagram reflects the current Zod schemas and client-side stores. It is a
logical view of the frontend model, not a claim that these are database tables
or that the indicated references are enforced by a database.

```

`DATASET`, `DISTRIBUTION`, `CONTRIBUTOR`, and `COST` are nested values in the
DMP draft, not independent records in the current client model. Likewise,
`DMP_VERSION` describes entries in `DmpRecord.versions`, embedded in each DMP
record. The ERD draws these nested structures separately to make their
relationships legible. `DOMAIN_PROFILE` is a code registry
(`src/schemas/dataset/domain-profiles.ts`), drawn because every dataset's
`domain_metadata` is validated against it.

## Plan rules the schema enforces

`dmpSchema` refuses a plan, and the readiness list names the field and
focuses its input when clicked, when:

- the end date is before the begin date;
- ethical issues exist but have no description;
- there isn't exactly one contact among the contributors;
- two contributors are linked to the same account;
- the contact has no email (maDMP v3.0 requires `contact.mbox`);
- an open distribution has no licence (maDMP v3.0 requires it);
- a dataset's `domain_metadata` doesn't satisfy its domain profile.

## Accounts and sign-up

Accounts are held in the browser (`src/store/authStore.ts`); there is no
server yet. Signing up (`/register`, `registrationSchema`) creates one `USER`
and one `CREDENTIAL`:

- **Only researchers sign up.** `role` is always `researcher`; committee and
  chief accounts are granted by the institution, not chosen.
- **Account type** decides who approves a researcher's plans.
  `institutional` (มีสังกัด) researchers must name their organisation, and
  their new projects default to `plan_mode: institutional`. `citizen`
  (ไม่มีสังกัด) researchers have no affiliation, may give an address, and
  their new projects default to `independent`. The default is applied when a
  project is created; a plan then pins its own mode at first submission, as
  below.
- **The password lives only in `CREDENTIAL`**, as a salted SHA-256 hash. It
  is never on `USER`, so nothing that reads users (exports, approver records,
  contributor links) can carry it. This keeps plain text out of storage but is
  not production security; a deployment moves sign-in behind an API.
- **Usernames are unique** (lowercased) and **emails are unique** ignoring
  case and spaces, checked at sign-up and when a profile's email is changed.
  Email uniqueness is what lets the contributor form suggest *the* account
  matching a contributor's email.
- **Who acts.** Records written while someone is signed in are attributed to
  them (`actingUserId()` in `src/config/current-user.ts`): project
  membership on creation, uploads, minor edits, self-finalizing, completed
  tasks. Notifications about a plan go to its project's researcher, whoever
  triggered them. Seed data stays attributed to the seeded researcher.

## Versions and edit classification

A plan becomes active at version 1, approved by a committee (institutional
projects) or finalized by the researcher (independent projects). After that,
the working draft is compared with the snapshot of the active version
(`src/config/plan-diff.ts`):

- **Minor-only edits** are applied to the active version and logged in its
  `minor_edits`. No new version is created and nothing is reviewed.
- **Any major edit** makes the whole batch major. Submitting creates the next
  numbered version with status `pending`; the active version stays in force
  until a decision.

Whether an edit is major is decided only by `isMajorTrigger` in
`src/config/field-policy.ts`: `dmpFieldPolicy` and `datasetFieldPolicy` for
single fields, `planListPolicy` for adding or removing list entries. The diff
compares every field those policies name, and the "needs sign-off again" list
shown to people is generated from the same flags. Tests enforce both.

Currently major: begin date, end date, ethical issues, Indigenous
considerations; a research output's access, personal data, personal data
plan, protection level, and security classification; adding or removing a
research output. Contributor (including contact) and cost changes are minor.

**Removing a research output** from a plan in force is proposed, not applied:
its tasks keep running until the version that drops it is put in force, and
are cancelled (never deleted) then, with a `tasks_cancelled` notification
(`src/store/planEffects.ts`). While the removal waits, the output still
counts as existing, because `datasetExists` reads the version in force.

**Plan mode is frozen at first submission**, the same way an approver is
snapshotted at decision time. A DMP records `plan_mode` when it is first
submitted (or self-finalized) and keeps it, so a later change to its
project's mode, or the project's deletion, can't move a plan between
committee approval and self-finalizing. Every reader goes through
`planModeOf`, which takes the frozen value first; there is no project-only
lookup for a plan. Plans submitted before freezing existed were frozen on
load (storage version 2) with their project's mode at that time.
Unsubmitted drafts follow their project until they're submitted. `deleteProject`
(`src/store/projectActions.ts`) refuses while a project still has plans.

**One revision waits at a time.** `submitRevision` is refused while another
version is pending, since a second would be built on a version that may never
be approved.

**Minor fixes while a revision waits** go onto the version in force, like
any minor edit, and the pending snapshot stays frozen. A *new* edit is one
that matches neither the version in force nor the pending snapshot; only those
can be saved, and only if all are minor. When the revision is approved, the
fixes made to the version in force since its submission (the difference
between its `based_on` snapshot and the version in force now) are replayed
into it by entity id, and recorded in `carried_minor_edits`. A fix to an
output the revision removed can't land, and is recorded in
`dropped_minor_edits` rather than lost silently. If the revision is sent
back, the fixes simply stay on the version in force. On approval the working
copy is also rebased onto the newly approved version, keeping only edits
nobody has saved or submitted, so a copy that didn't carry the revision can't
read as an edit undoing it.

**Cancel on a plan waiting for its first decision** keeps the submission with
the committee as submitted; only edits made since are dropped.

**Restoring a version** loads a version's snapshot into the working draft
(`restoreVersion`). Restoring the version in force discards unsubmitted
edits and records nothing, since nothing in force changes. Restoring any
other version, an earlier approved one or one that was sent back, is from
then on an ordinary edit: it's compared with the version in force and saved
(minor) or submitted for sign-off (major) like any other, so a rollback can't
skip approval. The resulting version or minor edit records `restored_from`.
A version still waiting on a decision can't be restored.

## Preservation: nothing that records work is destroyed

Tasks and their evidence are the record of work actually done, so:

- **There is no way to delete a plan.** `archiveDmp` sets it aside instead,
  and is refused while the plan is in force. Archived plans drop out of
  My DMPs, Tasks and project views, keep everything they held, can be found
  under My DMPs' *Archived* filter, and come back with `unarchiveDmp`.
- **Leaving the editor** (`closeDraft`, the editor's Cancel) never deletes:
  a plan in force only loses unsubmitted edits; an unsubmitted plan is
  archived.
- **A task with recorded work can't be deleted**: evidence attached, a
  ticked step, or a completion (`hasRecordedWork`). It can be cancelled,
  keeping its evidence. Only a task nobody has started can be deleted.
- **A finished task can't be cancelled**, which would overwrite the record
  of its completion; it can only be reopened.
- **A cancellation records what it replaced** (`cancelled_from`, the reason,
  and for a removed output its title). When a version brings an output back,
  tasks cancelled by its removal are *offered* for reopening, never reopened
  automatically, since their cancellation went through sign-off. Each is
  chosen individually, returns to the status it had, and is relinked to the
  returned output (matched by id, or by the recorded title if it came back
  under a new id). Tasks cancelled by hand aren't offered.
- `deleteProject` refuses while a project has plans, archived ones included,
  since deleting it would orphan them.

## Calendar dates

Dates without a time of day (plan begin/end, task start/end, domain dates)
are stored as a `Date` at midnight UTC and read only through
`src/utils/calendarDate.ts`. Dates saved earlier at local midnight are
recognised and read as the day that was picked. Exports write them as
`YYYY-MM-DD`. Timestamps (`created_at`, `decided_at`, `uploaded_at`, …) are
full date-times and unaffected.

## Standards exports

Exports are projections of a validated plan, not stored entities. Once a plan
has a version in force, the export describes **that version's snapshot**, not
the working draft: edits that haven't been saved (minor) or approved (major)
are left out, and the export panel says so. Before the first approval, the
draft is exported, with an approval status of `not submitted` or `submitted`.

| Export | Mapper | Validated against |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GCWG-RDA maDMP v3.0 | `src/schemas/madmp/mapper.ts` | `src/schemas/madmp/vendor/` |
| RDA DMP Common Standard v1.3 | `src/schemas/rda/mapper.ts` | `src/schemas/rda/vendor/` |

The maDMP export takes its `approval` block from the DMP status, plan mode,
and the active version's `approver`. Independent plans export as
`not applicable`. RDA has no approval block or classification fields;
protection and security travel in `security_and_privacy`. Both exports carry
`domain` and `domain_metadata` as extensions.

## AI calls

The frontend is built against the contract in `src/api/aiContract.ts`. A
mock backend (`src/api/mock/aiServer.ts`) honours it until the real one
exists, using the account record as its database.

- **The quota belongs to the server.** It enforces the limit, charges each
  call, and answers a quota request (`limit`, `used`, `resets_at`). The UI
  never hardcodes a limit or adds up spend. It re-reads the quota on sign-in
  and after every AI call, including calls that failed or were stopped. A
  pre-flight "not enough tokens" check is only a hint. While the figure is
  unknown the call goes through and the server decides.
- **Usage is reported split** into input, output and cached input, so the
  quota policy can be chosen with the numbers in hand. The mock charges
  input + output.
- **Failures are structured.** Each `AiError` has a `code`, a `retryable`
  flag, a message written for the researcher, any usage already counted,
  and, for `quota_exceeded`, `resets_at`. The UI offers "Try again" only
  when the call is retryable. A chat failure stays in the thread with its
  request.
- **Stop** aborts the request on the client. The server has already
  processed the prompt, so those tokens still count. The UI says so and
  re-reads the quota.
- **A reply belongs to the plan it was asked about.** Each request records
  which plan's thread it was made from. A request made before any plan
  existed follows `adopt(unscoped → id)` into the plan that adopted that
  conversation. The reply is always recorded there. It is only applied to
  the open draft if that plan is still open *and* the field hasn't changed:
  - A field rewrite that comes back to an unchanged field is applied (with
    an Undo that only reverses the rewrite itself). Otherwise it's kept on
    its plan's thread as a suggestion: pending if the person moved to another
    plan, marked stale if the field changed.
  - Chat and batch suggestions are drafted against the plan as it was when
    asked. Any whose field moved meanwhile are marked stale before they're
    shown. Accepting re-checks again (`guardBeforeApply`).
  - A plan drafted from a proposal opens only if the person is still on the
    plan they started from. Otherwise it's filed in My DMPs with an "Open
    it" toast. A second pass over a thin draft replaces it in place instead
    of filing a copy.
  - Generated tasks always belong to the plan they were made for.
- **Provenance gates the confidence note.** The analysis may return, per
  field, where a value came from: the proposal (with section/quote), or
  `none` (the proposal didn't cover it, so the value is a guess). The form
  shows "From proposal" or "AI guessed" only from that. With no provenance
  it claims nothing. A person's edit, or an AI rewrite, retires the field's
  provenance. The mock reads nothing from the file, so it returns none.

## Open questions

Edge cases found in review that need a decision on intended behaviour before
they're built.

1. ~~**Deleting a plan leaves its tasks.**~~ Resolved: plans can't be
   deleted. Archiving is refused while a plan is in force, and otherwise keeps
   the plan and its tasks intact. See *Preservation* above.
2. ~~**No way back after a send-back.**~~ Resolved: "Discard changes"
   restores the version in force, and a sent-back revision can be restored to
   fix and resubmit. See *Restoring a version* above.
3. ~~**Plan mode for unsubmitted plans.**~~ Resolved: the mode is frozen at
   first submission. Until then a draft follows its project, by design.
4. **Generated ids repeat across plans.** The demo analysis gives every plan
   the same ids (`seed-dataset-1`, `seed-contributor-1`, …), so exported
   dataset ids and contributor identifiers collide between different DMPs.
   Real analysis must mint unique ids; should exports also namespace ids by
   plan (for example `dmp-id/dataset-id`) as a safeguard?
5. **AI quota policy.** What counts against the limit (output only, input +
   output, cached input discounted), and when it resets (monthly, rolling,
   never). Until it's decided the UI shows no reset date. Once the server
   sends `resets_at`, the meter and the "budget spent" message show it.

## Review of the proposed ERD

- **DMP cardinality:** the code allows a DMP to have no `project_id`, and one
  project can have multiple DMPs. A mandatory one-to-one relationship does not
  match the schemas or seeded data.
- **Project fields:** the schema includes `plan_mode`. `ProjectStatus` is
  `draft | active | done`.
- **DMP fields:** `DmpForm` carries `alternate_identifier`, begin/end dates,
  ethical and indigenous information, contributor/cost/dataset arrays, and
  `schema_version`. There is no `current_version`, `generated_by`, `contact`,
  or DMP-level access or classification field; the contact is the contributor
  with `is_contact`, and the export rolls classifications up from datasets.
  The active revision is `active_version`, and status/timestamps plus summary
  fields are held by `DmpRecord`.
- **Versions and approvals:** versions exist as nested `PlanVersion` values;
  there is no separate `version_id` or `APPROVAL` entity. A decision is
  recorded on the version itself: `status`, `decided_at`, `decided_by`,
  `note`, and `approver` (name, position, email, and `user_id` when the
  approver is a project committee member). One decision per version, so a
  committee with several reviewers would need its own table.
- **Tasks and files:** tasks include cancelled status, priority, lifecycle
  stage, checklist, evidence, completion fields, and optional dataset/file
  references. File purpose includes `task_deliverable` and `evidence`. An
  optional task `file_id` may point to a file, but evidence references are
  polymorphic strings (file, URL, or DOI) rather than guaranteed file FKs.
  `source_version_id` is declared but never written, so tasks don't record
  which plan version produced them.
- **Notifications:** the type values are `dmp_submitted`, `dmp_approved`,
  `dmp_finalized`, `tasks_generated`, `tasks_cancelled`,
  `proposal_superseded`, `review_requested` (to every reviewer when a plan or
  revision is submitted), and `dmp_returned` (to the researcher when a
  version is sent back). A
  notification has title/message/link, optional DMP and project IDs, and
  optional `read_at`; it has no generic `related_entity` or `is_read` field.
- **AI generation:** there is no `AI_GENERATION` record with inputs, outputs,
  or token totals. AI activity is a separate persisted thread store of
  user/assistant turns and lightweight events, scoped by DMP ID when available
  (or stored as unscoped activity). Its actions are `analyze_proposal`,
  `regenerate_field`, `batch_regenerate`, `generate_tasks`, and
  `redraft_steps`. See *AI calls* for how replies, quota and failures work.
- **Contributors and users:** a contributor may be linked to an account
  through the optional `contributor.user_id`; collaborators without accounts
  stay unlinked. The contributor form offers the account whose email matches
  (case-insensitive) but never links on its own. One account links to at most
  one contributor per plan. Changing the link is a minor edit like any other
  contributor change, and the change list shows account names, not ids. The
  link stays internal: maDMP and RDA exports identify people by ORCID or
  email. The link is a plain string, so an account removed later leaves an
  "Unknown account" that the form flags. Nothing acts on the link yet;
  assigning tasks to contributors and notifying them are still to be built.
- **IDs and constraints:** many input-schema IDs are optional, and references
  are plain strings rather than validated foreign keys. Nested IDs (dataset,
  contributor, cost) are unique only within their plan. `(project_id,
  user_id)` is unique in `PROJECT_MEMBER` by the store, not the schema:
  `addMember` refuses an existing pair (and won't change a role as a side
  effect), and duplicates in saved data are dropped on load. Treat the other
  PK/FK labels here as logical relational recommendations, not enforced
  constraints.
